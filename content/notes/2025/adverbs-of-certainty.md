## Background

Recently I've been thinking about words like _obviously_ and _naturally_. There are many similar words. In order of strength:

- definitely
- obviously
- naturally
- possibly
- maybe


I'd like to learn more about them to use them more effectively. Years ago, I've transitioned from using _naturally_ instead of _obviously_. I also love using the word maybe. With regard to these types of words, I want to know:

- The name of their classification
- How they relate to the rest of linguistics

## Research

After a bit of research, I've come to learn that these words are colloquially called _adverbs of certainty_. However, that doesn't seem to be a linguistic term. Instead, _modal adverbs_ seems to be what I'm looking for. It's related to _grammatical mood_.

Modal adverbs are adverbs that express modality.

Modality refers to how language can express relationships to reality or truth. They include:

- Modal auxiliaries
- Model adjectives

The concept of modality can be broken up into _flavors_. Some include:

- _Epistemic flavor_: possibilities compatible with some body of knowledge
- _Deontic flavor_: possibilities which are required given laws or norms that are obeyed in reality

For the case mentioned in the introduction to this blog, the epistemic flavor applies the most.

## Learnings

When I think about how the "world ought to be", I should think about the epistemic flavor of modality.

When I think about an event, whether inherently probable, deduced from past facts, or an inference from external information, I should think about the deontic flavor of modality.

Very simply, modality can be thought of a type of modifier for some described event or fact.
