This website was created with my own static site generator, [sauerkraut](https://github.com/hyperupcall-projects/sauerkraut). I chose to build my own solution because I wanted full control over the build process and I wanted my code to last (over decades).

The documents and files for this website can be found at [hyperupcall-projects/edwinkofler.com](https://github.com/hyperupcall-projects/edwinkofler.com).
